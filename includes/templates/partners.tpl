        <h1>TEDxLausanneChange Partners</h1>
        <p>TEDxLausanneChange is an event where ideas are shared in an open and stimulating context. With this in mind, we are looking for sponsors who want more than just advertising in turn for a financial contribution, we look for partners who can contribute to make the TEDx experience memorable.</p>
        <p>
            Since TEDx events are all about innovation and great ideas, we offer special sponsorship conditions to startups, in particular, the possibility to expose their ideas. <a href="htdocs/documents/Fundraising_Proposal-2.doc">Find more</a> information about the different types of sponsorship.</p>
