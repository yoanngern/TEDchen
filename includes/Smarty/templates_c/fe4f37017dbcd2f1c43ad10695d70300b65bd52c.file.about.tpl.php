        <h1>About TEDxLausanne</h1> 
        <article>
            <p>The TEDxLausanne community seeks to extend the TED experience at a regional level, highlighting exceptional people and creative works, connecting people across disciplines, creating conversations that drive action. We explore big questions with a broad spirit of inquiry.</p>

            <p>The first TEDxLausanne event was held in September 2010 at IMD business school, Lausanne. Around 100 participants attended. The feedback was overwhelmingly positive and encouraged us to organise another event. In January 2012, again in partnership with IMD, TEDxLausanne organized a full-scale event based on the theme “The future doesn’t just happen”. Once again, the event witnessed a huge success and was completely sold out (360 people attended it).</p>

            <p>TEDxLausanne 2013 will feature over 12 inspiring speakers and performers and welcome 350 participants. The TEDxLausanne team consists entirely of volunteers who are dedicated to the TED concept of “ideas worth spreading”. To ensure the continuity of TEDxLausanne and develop a local community around this concept, an association named “Lausanne Bounces” was founded. (TED does not allow legal entities to include TED or TEDx in their name.)</p>

        <h1>About TED</h1>
        <article>
            <p><a href="http://www.ted.com/" target="_blank">TED</a> is a nonprofit organization devoted to “ideas worth spreading”. Started in 1984 in California as a four-day conference about Technology, Entertainment, Design, TED has broadened its scope and grown to support those world-changing ideas with multiple initiatives. At TED, the world’s leading thinkers and doers are asked to give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes. Talks are then made available for free at <a href="http://www.ted.com/" target="_blank">TED.com</a>. TED speakers have included Bill Gates, Jane Goodall, Elizabeth Gilbert, Sir Richard Branson, Benoit Mandelbrot, Philippe Starck, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Isabel Allende and Gordon Brown. Two major TED events are held each year: The TED Conference takes place every spring in Long Beach, California (along with a parallel conference, TEDActive, in Palm Springs), and TEDGlobal is held each summer in Edinburgh, Scotland.</p>

            <p>
                TED’s media initiatives include <a href="http://www.ted.com/" target="_blank">TED.com</a>, where new TEDTalks are posted daily; the new TED Conversations, enabling broad conversations among TED fans; and the Open Translation Project, which provides subtitles and interactive transcripts as well as the ability for any TEDTalk to be translated by volunteers worldwide.
            </p>
            <p>
                TED has established the annual TED Prize, where exceptional individuals with a wish to change the world are given the opportunity to put their wishes into action; TEDx, which offers individuals or groups a way to host local, self-organized events around the world; and the TED Fellows program, helping world-changing innovators from around the globe to become part of the TED community and, with its help, amplify the impact of their remarkable projects and activities.

    <section id="about_tedx offset3 span6">
        <h1>About TEDx</h1>
        <article>
        <p>In the spirit of “ideas worth spreading”, <a href="http://www.ted.com/" target="_blank">TED</a> created a program called <a href="http://www.ted.com/tedx" target="_blank">TEDx</a>, consisting of local, independently organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. Live speakers and a few pre-recorded TEDTalk videos are combined to spark deep discussion and connection in a relatively small group. TED provides general guidance for the TEDx program, including rules and regulations that local organizers must follow. Hundreds of TEDx events have already been organized around the world. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events, including ours, are self-organized.
